        <p>Three wary bodies crunched across the unthawing snow. They mazed through a forest of giant and sapling pine on the lip of the bowl of the mountains. Their camp was several miles behind them and would be many miles more so the closer they came to reaching the small town beyond the highest mountain.  With determined pace they would make it in roughly seven hours.  By foot had been the only option for transportation because of the trail and because of the season. It changed each year on account of the snow, but many had taken a similar path at the end of each winter for decades.  Each year it had been the same snow. The three knew on which snow to walk and which snow to baulk.  The luxury to be able to fly over the presently looming treachery by helicopter was unaffordable. Had they the option to squander money on a less-perilous means of travel it would have been chosen. Alas, they were left wary and so wandered onward.
Detecting the fearful snow was a task saved for the husky. It wore a parti-color roan and grey fur coat and knew the treachery of the snow and the wood and the mountain.  Its owner, Jasper Hindt, moved to Alaska where he had passed the bar examination to practice environmental law. The husky was a puppy then, which Jasper had purchased judging it might be practical on the edges of civilization and life.  The other two travelers could not gather whether it had taken notice in them, but it did not resist their warmth and their commands. This morning it was a dog with many owners.
 The young woman, Helen Oswift, did not care for dogs or the icy forest but could tolerate them more than the biting bits of hoarfrost in her hair and Enurgy Oil's covetous investors.  She met Jasper, without his husky, when Jasper accepted the case against Enurgy in Enurgy Oil v. the People of Rohn in early December, three weeks ago.  She had family in Rohn&ndash;their ultimate destination&ndash; a mother, a father and a sister who had first brought to her attention the ecological rape of the small town which began years ago, how all of the engineering and incorporating went unchecked, that there might not have been any good but for capital purpose. Only recently had the companies actions begun to effect the town itself. Water was poisoned, wildlife was scarce, the skyline was changing and a pipeline was imminent.
