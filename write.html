        <p>One or a few in a thousand can say his words are his. In this sense I am a materialist.

        <br/>
        Haste
<br/>
        <br/>
Unacquainted with the ground,
cast, fresh from the air,
his face was a face
and then introduced with a sound.

Consider it a pleasantry
how clean and well met
the collision and the crack
now bound&ndash;
no will to consider
(or desire or care).
Place it on good fortune that excitement
is exciting and

Unacquainted with pools,
	with cherry pools, all teeming with self.
	His face was a face
	until flipped.

He motions toward life, 
	morphing like ink
	tipped on its side.

He is now
	as he is now:
	the walk and the way
	and the laced.
	Here he rests,
	lying face down,
	conquered, defeated
and claimed
by haste.
